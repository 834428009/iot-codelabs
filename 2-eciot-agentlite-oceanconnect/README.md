### Huawei LiteOS+NB-IoT-based Development Board Accesses the OceanConnect IoT Platform Through LWPAN

#### Scenario

- Many kinds of NB-IoT development boards are embedded with the Huawei LiteOS (an IoT OS). 
- The boards invoke its embedded interconnected middleware (protocol stack) to control the NB-IoT communication module, enabling sensor data to be rapidly reported to the OceanConnect IoT platform. 
- Originally, developers need to set up a complex E2E IoT interoperation solution to implement this scenario by themselves. Now, developers only need to compile applications based on the Huawei LiteOS SDK. The infrastructure construction duration is greatly shortened so that developers can focus more on creative application development.
