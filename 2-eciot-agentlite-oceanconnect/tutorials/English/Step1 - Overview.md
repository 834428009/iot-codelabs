## 1. Overview

In this codelab, you'll learn how to build IoT application using Huawei LiteOS. To achieve this you will implement a simple code and select a NB-IoT borad, while incorporating some features of AgentTiny which is used interconnect with the OceanConnect IoT Platform.

### What you'll learn

- How build a IoT project in NB-IoT developement boards
- The foundations of an Huawei LiteOS (a IoT OS)
- How to report the tempertuation data to the OceanConnect IoT Platform in Network(NB-IoT, Etherenet, or WiFi)
- How to validate your IoT application
- How to prepare your next buiness case.

### What you'll need

- The sample code
- ST-Link/V2-1 boards
- Compile Tools (Keil MDK for ARM)
- OceanConnect IoT Platform account and password
- NB-IoT SIM
- ENC28J60 / W5500 for Enternet or ESP8266 without NB-IoT network
